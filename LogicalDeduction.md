**Logical Deduction == Deductive Reasoning**

# **STATEMENT & CONCLUSION**
> We have to **tell** which is **true/follows**

![Conclusion1](src/Conclusion1.png)
Here 
1) **If only conclusion1 follows**
   -> matlab only conclusion1 true
2) **If only conclusion2 follows**
   -> matlab only conclusion2 true
3) **If either 1 or 2 follows**
   -> matlab ek toh 1 ya 2, dono mein se koi ek sahi hai
4) **If neither 1 nor 2 follows**
   -> matlab ek toh 1 ya 2, dono mein se koi ek sahi **nahi** hai
5) **If both 1 or 2 follows**
   -> matlab dono true

### Imp Concepts
* **Statement is always true**
* **Conclusion** is something which is **100% true**
* **Conclusion** mein dimag nahi lagana, **joh hai woh man lena**
![Conclusion2](src/conclusion2.png)
Here 
* *Sun rises in the east* is true, but no link with the statement, thats why **false**

> Inference == Conclusion

## Tips and Tricks
> **Conclusion must be general**, not specific

If it is specific then it can be false


#### 1) Do not make any assumption
![Tip and Trick 1](src/conctip1.png)
Here
Yaha aisa kahi nahi kaha ki, *teacher disliked ram*, so dont assume that teacher scolded so she will dislike
> **If it is mentioned** in statement **then only assume it**


#### 2) Advice or Result always True
![Tip and Trick 2](src/conctip2.png)
Here
Petroleum Products should be used efficiently. -> **advice**
So this **conclusion is true**
> If **advice** is given then it is **always true**

#### 3) Avoid Pre-assumptions
>**Baap kamjor** hai toh **beta strong nahi** ho sakta

![Tip and Trick 3](src/conctip3.png)
Here
* If statement is not sure, then conclusion must not be sure also
> If **statement is not sure**, **conclusion will always be unsure**

> If conclusion have these words
> **All, every, each, none, no-one, everyone, everybody, always**
> These **make conclusion false**, most of the time


>**Some, Many, Few, May , Might, May be**, make conclusion **true**

## IMP QUE
![imp que1](src/comcq1.png)
ex, no assumption or pre-assumption
we know only about india

#### either-or 
![imp que2](src/concq2.png)
* yaha lag raha hai ki D) sahi hai, par ya toh woh first aayega ya toh nahi, both can be true, thats why option C)
* mostly occur when there is **yes/no** condition, **toggle** condition, **if this/ or that** condition


## First check
> 1) For strong words

> 2) Whether conclusion is talking about the same thing as statement

> 3) Check for [either-or](#either-or-1) thing

ex of **comparison** and **every** word

ex of **comparison** and **half explained** word

![imp que3](src/argq3.png)
yaha mujhe confuse hua kyuki `"one of the ways"` likha hai, i thought it is a weak, because it is not confirm in itself, **but it is not like that**

![imp que4](src/argq4.png)
